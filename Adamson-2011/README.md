# Taking C Seriously

```
Dennis Ritchie, a co-creator of Unix and C, passed away...

It should hardly be necessary to state the importance of Ritchie's work.
C is the #2 language in use today according to the TIOBE rankings...

Keep in mind that C was developed between 1969 and 1973, making it nearly 40 years old.
... when Paul Grahan considered the possible traits of The Hundred-Year Language,
the one we might be using 100 years from now, he overlooked the fact that
C had already made an exceptionally good start on a century-long reign.

And yet, despite on being so widely used and so important, C is widely disparaged.
It is easy, and popular, and eminently tolerated, to bitch and complain about C's primitiveness.

I've already had my say about this, in the PragPub article Punk Rock Languages,
in which I praised C's lack of artifice and abstraction, its directness, and its ruthlessness.
