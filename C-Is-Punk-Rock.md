# C Is Punk Rock
---


```
C has only a handful of keywords and is a bit rough the edges, and it rocks.
You can do anything with it.
Like the C, G, and D chords on a guitar,
you can learn the basic mechanics quickly, and then spend the rest of your life getting better.
The people who don't get it
fear its power and think it too edgy to be safe.
By all rankings, it is consistently the most popular language
that doesn't have a corporation or foundation spending money to promote it.

This preface owes an obvious and huge debt to [Punk Rock Languages: A Polemic] by Chris Adamson.
[Punk Rock Languages: A Polemic](https://pragprog.com/magazines/2011-03/punk-rock-languages)

```
Also, the language is about 40 years old,
which makes it middle-aged.
It was written by a few guys basically working against management
- the perfect punk rock origins -
but that was on the 1970's,
and there's been a lot of time for the language to go mainstream.
