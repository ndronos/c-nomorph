# C Is Punk Rock
---


```
C has only a handful of keywords and is a bit rough the edges, and it rocks.
You can do anything with it.
Like the C, G, and D chords on a guitar,
you can learn the basic mechanics quickly, and then spend the rest of your life getting better.
The people who don't get it
fear its power and think it too edgy to be safe.
By all rankings, it is consistently the most popular language
that doesn't have a corporation or foundation spending money to promote it.
