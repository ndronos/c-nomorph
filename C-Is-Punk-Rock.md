# C Is Punk Rock
---


```
C has only a handful of keywords and is a bit rough the edges, and it rocks.
You can do anything with it.
Like the C, G, and D chords on a guitar,
you can learn the basic mechanics quickly, and then spend the rest of your life getting better.
The people who don't get it
fear its power and think it too edgy to be safe.
By all rankings, it is consistently the most popular language
that doesn't have a corporation or foundation spending money to promote it.

This preface owes an obvious and huge debt to [Punk Rock Languages: A Polemic] by Chris Adamson.

```
Also, the language is about 40 years old,
which makes it middle-aged.
It was written by a few guys basically working against management
- the perfect punk rock origins -
but that was on the 1970's,
and there's been a lot of time for the language to go mainstream.

```
What did people do when punk rock went mainstream?
In the decades since its advent in the 1970s,
punk certainly has come in from the fringes:
(to name just a few)... sold million of albums worldwide,
and I have heard lite instrumental versions of songs
from the punk rock spinoff known as grunge at my local supermarket.
...
One reaction to the continuing evolution would be take the hard line
and say that the original stuff was punk
and everything else is just easy punk pop for the masses.
The tradicionalists can still play their albums from the '70s,
and if the grooves are worn out, they can dowload a digitally mastered edition.
They can buy Ramones hoodies for their toddlers.
