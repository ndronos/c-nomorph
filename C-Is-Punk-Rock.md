# C Is Punk Rock
---


```
C has only a handful of keywords and is a bit rough the edges, and it rocks.
You can do anything with it.
Like the C, G, and D chords on a guitar,
you can learn the basic mechanics quickly, and then spend the rest of your life getting better.
The people who don't get it
fear its power and think it too edgy to be safe.
By all rankings, it is consistently the most popular language
that doesn't have a corporation or foundation spending money to promote it.

This preface owes an obvious and huge debt to [Punk Rock Languages: A Polemic] by Chris Adamson.

Also, the language is about 40 years old,
which makes it middle-aged.
It was written by a few guys basically working against management
- the perfect punk rock origins -
but that was on the 1970's,
and there's been a lot of time for the language to go mainstream.

What did people do when punk rock went mainstream?
In the decades since its advent in the 1970s,
punk certainly has come in from the fringes:
(to name just a few)... sold million of albums worldwide,
and I have heard lite instrumental versions of songs
from the punk rock spinoff known as grunge at my local supermarket.
...
One reaction to the continuing evolution would be take the hard line
and say that the original stuff was punk
and everything else is just easy punk pop for the masses.
The tradicionalists can still play their albums from the '70s,
and if the grooves are worn out, they can dowload a digitally mastered edition.
They can buy Ramones hoodies for their toddlers.

Outsiders don't get it. Some of them hear the word punk,
and picture something out of the 1970s
- a historic artifact about some kids that are, at the time,
really doing something different.
The traditionalist punks who stilllove and play their 1973 ... LPs
are having their fun,
but they bolster the impression that punk is ossified and no longer relevant.

Getting back to the world of C,
we have both the traditionalists, waving the banner of ANSI'89,
and those who will rock out to whatever works
and may not realize that the code they are writing
would not have compiled or run in the 1990s/
Outsiders don't get the difference.
They see still-in-print books from the 1980s
and still-online tutorials from the 1990s,
they near hear from the hardcore traditionalists
who insist on still writing like that today,
and they don't even know that the language
and the rest of its users continue to evolve.
That's a shame, because thet're missing out on some great stuff.

This is a book about breaking tradition and keeping C punk rock.
I don't care to compare the code this book
to the original C specification in Kernighan and Ritchie's 1978 book.
My telephone has 512 MB of memory,
so why arr our C textbooks still spending pages upon pages
covering techniques to shave kilobytes off our executables?
I am writing this on a bottom-of-the-line red netbook
that can accommodate 3,200,000,000 instructions per second;
what do I care about whether an operation requires comparing 8 bits or 16?
We should be writing code that we can write quickly
and that is readable by our fellow humans.
We're still writing in C, so our readable
but imperfectly optimized code will still run an order of magnitude faster
than if we'd written comparable code in any number of alternative,
bloated languages.

### Q & A (Or the Parameters of the Book)

```
Q: How is this book different from all others?

A:
Some are better written, some are even entertaining,
but C textbooks are somewhat uniform bunch...
Most are written before the C99 standard simplified
simplified many aspects of usage,
and you can tell some of those now in their nth edition
just pasted few notes about updated
rather than seriously rethinking how to use the language.
They all mention that there might be libraries
that you could maybe use in writing your own code,
but most predate the installation tools and ecosystem we have now,
which make using those libraries reliable and reasonably portable.
Those texbooks are still valid and still have value,
but modern C code just doesn't look like much of the code
in many of those textbooks.
