Semicolons

In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator.

That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon.
It indicates the end of one logical entity.

Comments

Comments are like helping text in your C program
and they are ignored by the compiler.

You cannot have comments within comments and
they do not occur within a string or character literals.
