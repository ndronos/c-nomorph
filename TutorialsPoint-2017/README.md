A C program basically consists of the following parts:

  - Preprocessor Commands
  - Functions
  - Variables
  - Statements and Expressions
  - Comments

Tokens in C

A C program consists of
    various tokens
    and a token is either

  - a keyword
  - an identifier
  - a constant
  - a string literal
  - a symbol

Semicolons

In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator.

That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon.
It indicates the end of one logical entity.

Comments

Comments are like helping text in your C program
and they are ignored by the compiler.

You cannot have comments within comments and
they do not occur within a string or character literals.

Identifiers

A C identifier is a name use to identify

  - a variable,
  - function,
  - or any other user-defined item.

An identifier starts with:

  - a letter A to Z, a to z,
  - or an underscore _

Followed by zero or more

  - letters
  - underscores
  - and digits (0 to 9)

C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers.

C is a case-sensitive programming language.

Keywords

The following list shows the reserved words in C.
These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.

  auto

  break

  case      char      const

  default   do        double

  else      enum      extern

  float     for

  goto

  if        int

  long

Whitespace in C

A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment,  is know as a blank line,
and a C compiler totally ignores it.

Whitespace is the term used in C to describe

  - blanks
  - tabs
  - newline characters
  - comments

Whitespece separates one part of a statement from another
and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement...
ends and the next begins.
Therefore in the... statement... there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space)
between... for the compiler to be able to distinguish them...
On the other hand... no whitespace character are necessary between... (operator)...
although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.
