## Preliminaries

```
The C programming language has been around for a long time
- the canonical reference if it is the book written by its creators...
Since then, C has been used in an incredible number of applications.
Programs and systems written in C are all around us:...
basically in any modern device that has a programmable interface.

``
In contrast to the ubuquitous presence of C programs and systems,
good knowledge of and about C is much more scarce.
Even experienced C programmers often appear to be stuck in some degree of
self-inflicted ignorance about the modern evolution of the C language.
A likely reason for this is that C is seen as an "easy to learn" language,
allowing a programmer with little experience to quickly write or copy
snippets of code that at least to do what it's supposed to.
I a way, C fails to motivate its users to climb to higher levels of knowledge.

```
This book is intended to change that general attitude.
It is organized in chapters called "Levels" that summarize levels of familiarity
with the C language and programming in general.
Some features of the language are presented in parts on earlier levels,
and elaborated in later ones...

As the title of this book suggests, today's C is not the same language
as the one originally designed by its creators...(usually referred to as K&R C).
In particular, it has undergone an important standardization and extension process
now driven by ISO, the International Standards Organization.
This led to three major publications of C standards
in the years 1989, 1999 and 2011, commonly referred to as C89, C99 and C11.
The C standards committee puts a lot effort into guaranteeing backwards compatibility
such that code written for earlier versions of the language, say C89,
should compile to a semantically equivalent executable with a compiler
that implements a newer version.
Unfortunately, this backwards compatibility has had the unwanted side effect of
not motivating projects that could benefit greatly from the new features
to update their code base.

In this book we will mainly referto C11, as defined in  JTC1/SC22/WG14 (2011)...

## Rule A :: C and C++ are different, don't mix them and don't mix them up.
