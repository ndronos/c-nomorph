## Preliminaries

```
The C programming language has been around for a long time
- the canonical reference if it is the book written by its creators...
Since then, C has been used in an incredible number of applications.
Programs and systems written in C are all around us:...
basically in any modern device that has a programmable interface.

``
In contrast to the ubuquitous presence of C programs and systems,
good knowledge of and about C is much more scarce.
Even experienced C programmers often appear to be stuck in some degree of
self-inflicted ignorance about the modern evolution of the C language.
A likely reason for this is that C is seen as an "easy to learn" language,
allowing a programmer with little experience to quickly write or copy
snippets of code that at least to do what it's supposed to.
I a way, C fails to motivate its users to climb to higher levels of knowledge.

```
This book is intended to change that general attitude.
It is organized in chapters called "Levels" that summarize levels of familiarity
with the C language and programming in general.
Some features of the language are presented in parts on earlier levels,
and elaborated in later ones...

## Rule A :: C and C++ are different, don't mix them and don't mix them up.
