# About C


```
Throw out your old ideas about C and get to know a programming language
that has substantially outgrown its origins.
... discover up-to-date techniques missing from other C tutorials,
whether you're new to the language or just getting reacquainted.

C isn't just the foundation of modern programming languages; it *is* a modern language,
ideal for writing efficient, state-of-the-art applications.

Get past idioms that made sense on mainframes
and learn the tools you need to work with this evolved and aggressively simple language. 

No matter what programming language you currently favor, you'll quickly see that *21st century C rocks*.

The computer world has undergone a revolution since the publication of *The C Programming Language* in 1978.
During this time, C has changed too, although only modestly, and it has spread far beyound its origins
as the language of the UNIX operating system.

C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book.

C wears well as one's experience with it grows.

C is a general-purpose programming language...
C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized
to any particular area of application.
But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks
than more powerful languages.

C is not tied to any particular hardware or systems,
however, and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on any machine that supports C.

In our experience, C has proven to be pleasant, expressive, and versatile language for a variety of programs.
It is easy to learn, and
it wears well as one's experience with it grows.

C is a general-purpose programming language.
It has been closely associated with the UNIX system where it was developed,
since both the system and most of the programs that run on it are written in C.
The language, however, is not tied to any one operating system or machine; 
and although it has been called a "system programming language" because it is useful for
writing compilers and operating systems, it has been used equally well
to write major programs in many different domains.

(K&R, 1988) 1 Introduction

```
C is a relatively "low level" language.
This characterization is not pejorative;
it simply means that C deals with the same sort of objects that most computers do,
namely characters, numbers, and adresses. These may be combined and moved about with
the arithmetic and logical operators implementedby real machines.

(K&R, 1998) 1-2 Introduction
```

```
Although the absence of some... features may seem like a grave deficiency...
keeping the language down to a modest size has real benefits.
Since C is relatively small, it can be described in a small space, and learned quickly.
A programmer can reasonably expect to know and understand and indeed regularly use the
entire language.
