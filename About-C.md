# About C


```
Throw out your old ideas about C and get to know a programming language
that has substantially outgrown its origins.
... discover up-to-date techniques missing from other C tutorials,
whether you're new to the language or just getting reacquainted.

C isn't just the foundation of modern programming languages; it *is* a modern language,
ideal for writing efficient, state-of-the-art applications.

Get past idioms that made sense on mainframes
and learn the tools you need to work with this evolved and aggressively simple language. 

No matter what programming language you currently favor, you'll quickly see that *21st century C rocks*.

The computer world has undergone a revolution since the publication of *The C Programming Language* in 1978.
During this time, C has changed too, although only modestly, and it has spread far beyound its origins
as the language of the UNIX operating system.

C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book.

C wears well as one's experience with it grows.

C is a general-purpose programming language...
C is not a "very high level" language, nor a "big" one, and is not specialized
to any particular area of application.
But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks
than more powerful languages.

C is not tied to any particular hardware or systems,
however, and it is easy to write programs that will run without change on any machine that supports C.

In our experience, C has proven to be pleasant, expressive, and versatile language for a variety of programs.
It is easy to learn, and
it wears well as one's experience with it grows.
