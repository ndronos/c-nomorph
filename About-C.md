# About C


```
Throw out your old ideas about C and get to know a programming language
that has substantially outgrown its origins.
... discover up-to-date techniques missing from other C tutorials,
whether you're new to the language or just getting reacquainted.

C isn't just the foundation of modern programming languages; it *is* a modern language,
ideal for writing efficient, state-of-the-art applications.

Get past idioms that made sense on mainframes
and learn the tools you need to work with this evolved and aggressively simple language. 

No matter what programming language you currently favor, you'll quickly see that *21st century C rocks*.
